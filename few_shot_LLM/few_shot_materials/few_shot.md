However, he's answer is \"I got the message, but I don't think the answer will change, so I don't need reply to you now. I will only approach to you once close to your reservation date.\"\n\nWhat a careless and arrogant reply!\n\nDo you understand there is a customer chase on you everyday and expecting your PROMPT reply?\n\nPS: I booked Zen just yesterday through email, everything done within 1 hour.\n\nUpdate: I spent SGD 10,557 in Zen, which I suppose spend in Les Amos.",

```json
{
  "review": "I seldom leave bad reviews but this is really one of the worst experiences I have had. I bought a pack of hay from this seller on shopee, received it rather quickly so I gave it a 5 star rating at first. Then I opened the hay to find that it was brown and containing a foul smell. I let my rabbit smell and he instantly ran away (kept some pictures, btw). I have bought the same brand from Pet Lover Center before and know it's supposed to smell fresh and green. They insisted that they don't sell unfresh and mouldy products so I went down to Pet Lover Center to ask, where the groomer there (who has rabbits herself) says it is not fresh and has been stored for too long. Seller said he can open the other packs for 1 for 1 exchange, or a refund. I decided since he says all his batches are like that then I would go for refund. He then asked me if I could change my rating on Shopee as the rating is for service not product. So then I said OK after receiving refund I will review. We still had to travel all the way down to his house to return the product. We never received any apology for all the inconvenience and still had to change the rating. I was thinking forget it nevermind, just do some good, went into shopee and realize the rating cannot be edited anymore. So I told the seller and still kindly suggested that he change the comments on his side to my review to say that issue is resolved. He said he could not change his comments and so decided to block me and gave me a 3/5 rating afterwards. Very unprofessional. Will warn my friends not to purchase from this store again.",

```json

  "review": "Burnt Ends is, unfortunately, more hype than substance. While the decor is stylish and the kitchen is staffed like a small army, that's precisely where the value ends.  The food itself is painfully overpriced for the portion sizes--you'll leave wondering if you've just paid fine-dining prices for tasting samples. The wine list is dominated by inflated Australian bottles, and the corkage fee is downright ridiculous, clearly designed to force customers into buying their overpriced selections.  Service feels less about genuine hospitality and more about covering up inefficiency; with so many people behind the counter, it's hard to justify the sluggishness. Honestly, the Michelin star is baffling--likely awarded for the interior design and theatrics of the open kitchen rather than the actual food or experience.  At the end of the day, you're not paying for exceptional cuisine--you're footing the bill for inflated wine margins, inefficiency, and hype.",

  "review": "Really cool store with lots of luxury brands. Nice selection of up and coming brands from South-East asia. The store has no problems itself in terms of selection. The design and layout of the store itself fits very well. However the only majot letdown is the staff. They lack initiative and passion about luxury clothes, they dont seem to be interested to be there or know much about the clothes being sold. Another issue is the 'selective discrimination'. I was genuinely interested in buying a t shirt so when i asked to try it on they said that it isnt possible, when i was looking around the store afterward i saw multiple customers trying on clothes with the help of the staff. Overall, really nice store but the staff are letdown, needs more passion (and some kindness lol)",

### Example 13
**User:** 
```json
{
  "review": "The fifth time I checked in at Ibid Restaurant, from ordinary to full of surprises!  Ibid Restaurant, founded by Chef Wu, the first champion of \"Master Chef Asia\", has always been a food treasure in my heart. This is my fifth time here. Although the first few dishes were mediocre, the main course has been surprising all the way, which conquered me again! ---- 1. Bread and appetizers * Sour dough bread: As stable as always, paired with mixed sesame oil and butter, the aroma is fragrant, and every time I eat it, I feel happy! * Nanyang-style small golden cup: full of creativity, but the taste is quite satisfactory. The preserved egg sauce is a bit special, but the overall feeling is average. * Indian-style small crispy balls (swordfish + lettuce): swordfish is paired with lettuce, plus the sour taste, refreshing and appetizing, the combination is clever, but the memory is not deep * Lamb tartare with perilla leaves: As an appetizer, this dish made me shine. The lamb is very tender, without any fishy smell, paired with perilla leaves, fresh and delicious, impressive. * Tofu with cherry tomatoes: marinated with Japanese rice wine and sugar, there is no other idea except sour. 2. Main course * Japanese chawan mushi: minced meat and spicy and sweet seasoning, plus a little Japanese clams and chili oil, the taste is a bit complicated. I personally don't like it, but my friends think it's okay. * New Zealand salmon: This dish is amazing! The salmon is marinated and made with a thin and crispy skin. The fish meat is handled very specially. The processing method is completely incomprehensible, and the taste is rich. * Beef: This dish is my favorite! Seasoned with red wine sauce, the sweet and sour taste is moderate, the beef tastes excellent, and it is chewy and very satisfying. 3. Dessert * Sour dessert: Hawthorn-flavored snow ice cream is paired with yogurt, sprinkled with roasted tomato skin, sour and sweet interweaving, refreshing and greasy. * Banana ice cream with caramel walnuts: The banana ice cream is rich and sweet, the caramel walnuts increase the taste, and the thin cracker slices on the top are the finishing touch, so delicious! 4. Drinks The last cold brew milky oolong tea, paired with handmade glutinous rice flour Madeleine cake, was the perfect ending. The cake was crispy, warm and delicious. ---- 5. Service and environment The environment of the restaurant is as comfortable as ever, and the service is very considerate. Chef Wu always feels very festive when I see him. This time he seems to be a little thinner, but still friendly. There are also Indian chef Daniel and restaurant manager Alex, who are both very professional. This time Alez also introduced the dishes in Chinese in detail, and the experience was very good. ---- 6. Summary The set meal price of Ibid restaurant has returned to 188++ (230 SGD per person), which is very cost-effective! Although the first few dishes were a bit bland, the surprise at the end made me feel that it was worth the price. Each dish has unique creativity and taste. Whether it is a creative dish or a classic dish, you can feel the chef's dedication. Highly recommended to everyone, I will come again next time!",

  "review": "As someone who values fine dining and the prestige associated with Michelin-starred establishments, my recent visit to Les Amis was a deeply disappointing experience. Despite its accolades, the treatment I received was far from what one would expect from a world-class restaurant.  One of the most unsettling aspects of the evening was the apparent discriminatory service. While Caucasian guests were warmly welcomed and attentively served, my party -- composed of Asian diners -- experienced noticeably less care and enthusiasm. This kind of preferential treatment is unacceptable in any setting, let alone one that claims to offer refined hospitality.  To make matters worse, the pacing of the meal was completely off. Courses were rushed out even while I was still engaged in conversation with the sommelier. It felt more like we were being hurried out than being invited to enjoy a thoughtfully curated dining journey. The lack of grace and attentiveness was jarring.  The overall service was inconsistent and impersonal, making it clear that not all guests are treated with the same standard of excellence. For a restaurant that holds itself to Michelin standards, the experience was not just underwhelming -- it was alienating.  In my opinion, Les Amis does not live up to its Michelin status. Fine dining is not just about food -- it's about respect, hospitality, and the complete experience. Based on what I encountered, this restaurant falls short on all fronts.",
